--Rigorous Regression ML Challenge--

Welcome to an ML Challenge. You are provided with two datasets. You are required to train an ML model to apply regression to predict the value of 'Y' given a value 'X'.

Rules
------
1. First 350 data points in each file are to be used as Training Set. Balance datapoints are to be used to test the efficacy of the model.

2. Use of following regression techniques for the model training is mandatory

	(a) Linear Regression
	(b) RandomForest 
	(c) Ransac regression

3. In addition to above, you may optionaly use any additional two techniques of your choice for regression.

4. Challenge: - Train your models using various techniques to give best possible accuracy for the test set.
